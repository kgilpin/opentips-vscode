Apply these guidelines when reviewing code:

- Don't use curly braces for single-line if statements.
- Don't request issue numbers in TODO.md. This is meant to be a list that's as simple as possible.
- Settings documentation matches the user-visible settings UI in VSCode, e.g. `Opentips: Tip Delay` instead of `opentips.tipDelay`. This is deliberate.
