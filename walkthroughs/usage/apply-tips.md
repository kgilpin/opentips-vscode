You can click on a tip in the OpenTips panel to view that tip in your code.

Once you've got a tip, there are four actions you can take:

- **`</>` Apply**: Apply the tip to your code. This will automatically update your code to reflect the changes suggested by the tip.
- **`?` Explain**: See an explanation of the tip. This will help you understand why the tip is important and how it will improve your code.
- **`📋` TODO**: Add a TODO comment to the code with the review suggestion. This allows you to keep track of suggestions that you want to address later.
- **`🗑️` Dismiss**: Dismiss the tip. This will remove the tip from the OpenTips panel and you won't see it again.
