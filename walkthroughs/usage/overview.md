Welcome to OpenTips! Here's a quick feature tour to help you get started.

To use OpenTips, create a Git-based workspace:

- Install Git for Windows from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Install Git for MacOS:
  - Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install git`
  - Using XCode: `xcode-select --install`
- Install Git for Linux using your package manager
- Verify Git installation using `git --version`

Your workspace should have a base branch named `main`, `master`, or `develop`.

Once you start making code changes, OpenTips will provide suggestions based on those code changes relative to the base branch.
